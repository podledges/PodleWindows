# Git for Windows bundles a Cygwin `ps` with no `-o` support at all (only
# -aefls/-p/-u/-W), and Cygwin/MSYS2 both report a process's parent as the
# synthetic orphan pid 1 the moment that parent was never spawned through
# their own pid database - which is exactly what happens when a native
# Windows harness such as claude.exe launches a Cygwin bash.exe. The identity
# and ancestry functions below read /proc as a same-host fallback for the
# first problem and fall through to the real Windows process table (via
# powershell.exe) for the second; every fallback triggers only after the
# platform-generic path already failed, so Linux and macOS behavior is
# unchanged.

# Walk the current process ancestry (up to 16 hops) and print this session's

# "<pid>\t<kind>", where kind is "session" for an ordinary harness process and
# "shared-host" for the multi-session background daemon recognized by
# fm_harness_args_is_shared_host.
#
# The walk climbs freely until the first harness match, because the caller is
# normally an ordinary shell several levels below its session. After that first
# match it stops at the first non-harness ancestor, so it can never cross a gap
# into an unrelated harness further up the real process tree - for example the
# live session that launched a test as its own subprocess.
#
# For every harness except Claude the innermost match is the session, which is
# where e.g. Pi's shared signed-wrapper ancestry actually holds the lock: a
# "pi-signed" launcher can be the direct parent of the inner "pi" engine pid that
# owns the lock, and the wrapper pid above it is not that owner. Claude Code
# instead runs hooks several levels below the session inside its own nested
# worker chain (hook shell -> claude bg-spare -> claude bg-pty-host -> claude ->
# claude), with no non-harness process between them. Which pid in that run is the
# session cannot be read off the ancestry at all, so the whole contiguous run is
# reported and the callers below decide what they need from it.
#
# `ps -o` is tried first on every pid, unchanged from every other platform;
# /proc is read only when that produced nothing (Cygwin's `ps`, see the file
# header). If the walk still reaches the top with no match at all, and the last
# pid it could read has a real Windows pid behind it, the walk continues into
# the real Windows ancestry above the synthetic boundary.
